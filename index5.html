        CSS is a stylesheet language used to design the appearance of web pages. CSS helps control the colors of text and backgrounds, font sizes, and the distribution of elements on a page. With CSS, we can make a website more attractive and user-friendly. Learning CSS is an essential step for any web developer. There are numerous properties in CSS, such as alignment, margins, letter spacing, and indentation. Each of these properties contributes to a better user experience. In this example, we use a set of properties to format a long paragraph and make it easier to read and comfortable for the eyes. These properties can be modified as needed to achieve the ideal result.
